# Laptop Price Tracker Project: Structured Implementation Plan

## 0. Preparation & Compliance
- **Research and document** Amazon’s Terms of Service regarding automated access and permissible data usage.
- **Set project scope:** Focus on a single, manageable laptop category (e.g., “gaming laptops”) to start.
- **List required data fields:** (ASIN, title, current price, old price, specs, rating, reviews, stock, delivery, etc.)

## 1. Web Scraping: Data Acquisition
- **Select target URLs:** Gather links for the desired category or search results on Amazon.
- **Develop scraper:** Use Playwright, Selenium, or Scrapy to extract:
  - Product title, ASIN, clean URL, thumbnail, rating, reviews, price, old price, specs (RAM, storage, display), stock status, delivery details.
- **Handle anti-bot measures:** Use rotating user-agents, delays, and proxies if necessary.
- **Save data to a Python list of dictionaries** (one per product).
- **Data quality checks:** Validate completeness, handle missing values, and deduplicate entries by ASIN.

## 2. Data Storage: Saving Results
- **Primary storage:** Save current scrape to a CSV file for initial testing and exploration (use pandas).
- **Design database schema:** Plan a PostgreSQL table with:
  - Primary key: (ASIN, timestamp)
  - Columns: All scraped fields, timestamps, and any computed features.
- **Migrate to database:** Learn and set up PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB. Create scripts to insert and update records over time while preserving history.

## 3. Automation & Incremental Updates
- **Schedule scraping:** Use cron, Airflow, or Task Scheduler to run scrapers at chosen intervals (e.g., every 6 or 12 hours).
- **Append new data:** Only track new or updated products, avoid redundant inserts.
- **Monitor scraper health:** Log job status, catch and alert errors, change parsers if website structure changes.

## 4. Feature Engineering & Analytics
- **Price dynamics:** Calculate the following for each product:
  - Price drop/increase since last check (absolute and percent)
  - Rolling minimum, maximum, and average prices
  - Historical low tracker ("Is now the best price?")
- **Buy/Sell decision flags:**
  - Simple “should I buy?” signals based on price thresholds or historical lows.
  - Mark products with largest price drops or increases in last 24–72h.
  - Forecast “likely discount days” using trend analysis (simple moving averages or time-series models).
- **Product ranking:** Flag most attractive deals, highest overall discount, or rare price spikes.

## 5. Visualization & Dashboard (Optional, but highly recommended)
- **Build a dashboard** using Dash, Streamlit, or Jupyter widgets to display:
  - Price history graphs per product.
  - Top trending deals and alert-worthy products.
  - Analytical summaries (e.g., average price drop over time, best time to buy).
- **Add filters/search:** Let users select by brand, RAM, price, and other specs.

## 6. Alerting (Nice Enhancement)
- **Set up notifications:** Email, Telegram, or SMS alerts for price drops crossing a defined threshold, or rare discounts.
- **Configurable rules:** Let users set their own price-watch criteria for specific models.

## 7. Maintenance & Scaling
- **Data validation:** Regularly check for missing or inconsistent data; re-scrape as needed.
- **Legal review:** Stay updated on Amazon’s and local laws/platform rules.
- **Performance tuning:** Add more proxies, optimize scrapers as you scale, adjust scraping intervals as needed.
